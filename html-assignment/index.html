              My name is Noyal Kanjirathingal Jose, But I usually go by Noyal KJ. I am from India and am currently pursuing my studies in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at algonquin collage,Canada.
              I choose this program because I enjoy learning and discovering both the creative and technical aspects of the field, which i believe will be beneficial for my future plans. I have many goals,one of which
              is to travel to various countries to experience different cultures and nature.The skills I am gaining from this program will support these future objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I have a strong love for music,as it bring me happiness.There's something unique about music that i want to explore more,and one of my goals is to learn to play various instruments in 
              the future.I am someone who faces many fears, but i am determined to confront them.While I may experience failure along the way,I will continue to try and push forward.
            </p>
